Agenda:

•	-  Create a master-detail Android application that lists your favorite character’s comics:
- The master scene will display all the comics for the character, where each cell will display the comic’s title and thumbnail image.
- The detail screen will display a random image for the selected comic, along with the title and the description of the comic (or any other relevant information you want).

•	-  Use the Marvel Public API http://developer.marvel.com/docs in order to fetch your character’s comics.
•	-  Store your project in your public Github account.


Take special care when developing your app to these key points:

•	-  Project architecture

•	-  Design Patterns

•	-  Best practices


•	Bonus Points:

•	-  MultiThreading

•	-  Unit Tests

•	-  Instrumentational tests

•	-  Animations

•	-  Scrolling performance


Considerations:
•	-  You are given complete freedom over what UX to implement, what pretty colors to put in the navigationBar... the design details are up to you.

•	-  You can use 3rd party libraries
